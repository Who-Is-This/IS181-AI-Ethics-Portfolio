# Research Conclusions

## Key Findings
1. **AI as Tool, Not Replacement**: Participants consistently viewed AI as a supportive tool that should enhance human capabilities rather than replace human judgment or creativity.

2. **Ethical Responsibility**: Strong consensus that developers should bear primary responsibility for AI actions, with governments playing a regulatory role.

3. **Trust Boundaries**: Clear delineation of trust boundaries, with participants willing to trust AI for data-driven tasks but not for decisions requiring emotional intelligence or ethical judgment.

4. **Future Development**: Support for continued AI development in areas that benefit humanity, with strict ethical boundaries and human oversight.

## Implications
This research highlights the importance of maintaining a human-centered approach to AI development. As AI technology advances, there must be careful consideration of where and how AI is deployed, with particular attention to maintaining human oversight in sensitive areas.

The varying perspectives across professional backgrounds underscore the need for interdisciplinary approaches to AI ethics, ensuring that diverse viewpoints inform development practices and regulatory frameworks.

## Future Research Directions
- Larger-scale studies with more diverse participant pools
- Longitudinal studies tracking changes in AI perceptions over time
- Targeted research on specific high-impact areas like healthcare AI applications
- Exploration of effective regulatory frameworks for AI development
