# Ethics of AI Development Portfolio

## Project Overview
This portfolio showcases my IS181 final project focusing on the ethics of AI development, exploring control, trust, and risk factors in the context of artificial general intelligence.

## Research Focus
My research explored the ethical implications of AI development through a focus group discussion with participants from diverse backgrounds including technology, medicine, and social sciences. The study examined perspectives on:
- Current AI usage in personal and professional contexts
- Boundaries of AI application
- Responsibility for AI actions
- Trust levels in AI systems
- Future directions for AI development

## Key Findings
- Participants valued AI as a supportive tool but emphasized the need for human oversight
- Strong consensus that developers should bear responsibility for AI actions
- Varied trust levels across different applications, with healthcare and governance seen as requiring strict human control
- Universal agreement on the need for ethical boundaries in AI development
